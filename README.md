# pynculator-cli

A simple calculator CLI app made with Python.

This calculator app is aimed to be lightweight and cross-platform.

for an Android version of this, you can use an app like termux to emulate a Linux environment and run this script on that emulated environment, or use an app like pydroid3. This is not officially supported but my testing shows that it works flawlessly with this method.
