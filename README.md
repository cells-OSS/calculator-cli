# pynculator-cli

A simple calculator CLI app made with Python.

This calculator app is aimed to be lightweight and cross-platform.

For an Android version of this, you can use an app like termux to emulate a Linux environment and run this script on that emulated environment, or use an app like pydroid3. This is not officially supported but my testing so far shows that it works flawlessly using pydroid3.

# PREREQUISITES
Python (https://www.python.org/)

# HOW TO USE?

It is pretty simple, you just launch the python file and choose which option you want to go with from the welcome message. If you want to change to a different mode typing "back" will take you back to the welcome message where you can choose a different option.
